# Criminal Intent

## Synopsis

Criminal Intent is an android app meant to record the details of “office crimes” – things like
leaving dirty dishes in the break room sink or walking away from an empty shared printer after
documents have printed.

With Criminal Intent, you can make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. You
can also identify a suspect from your contacts and lodge a complaint via email, Twitter, Facebook,
or another app. After documenting and reporting a crime, you can proceed with your work free of
resentment and ready to focus on the business at hand.
